## Capstone
 The Capstone Project for my Data Analysis Diploma focused on
 cleaning and modeling messy sales data using Power Query and Power BI.
 I built a relational data model, dynamic slicers, and KPI comparisons (Sales, Profit, COGS, Quantity)
 to create an interactive dashboard.
 The purpose was to deliver clear business insights — from return rates and product performance to sales trends — and demonstrate how data can drive smarter decisions.

## Data Used
- Power BI file: [A Capstone.pbix](A%20Capstone%20Power%20BI/A%20Capstone.pbix)
