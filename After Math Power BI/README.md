## Z After Math My First Time using Power-BI
The “After Math” project started with messy, error-filled sales data. Using Excel, Power Query, and Power Pivot, I cleaned and standardized the dataset, added missing calculated fields (COGS, Sales, Unit Cost), and built measures to keep the model efficient. The final dashboard combined all order statuses into one interactive view with Slicers.

Purpose:
To practice data cleaning, modeling, and dashboard design on a corrupted dataset, and show how structured analysis can turn confusion into clear, actionable insights.

## Data Used
- Power BI file: [Z AFTER MATH.pbix](After%20Math%20Power%20BI/Z%20AFTER%20MATH.pbix)
